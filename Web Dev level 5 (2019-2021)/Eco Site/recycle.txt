Recycling

If you cannot re-use items, the next best thing is to recycle them. Most recycling centres will accept newspapers, cardboard, cans, glass, clothes and bedding, etc. The larger centres will take electrical and electronic items such as washing machines, fridges, computers, etc. A few take garden waste and even metal, wood and old furniture.

Most kitchen and garden waste can be composted. The list below shows what NOT to put in your compost heap.

Meat - will attract vermin
Cooked food - will attract vermin
Potato peelings - you'll have potato plants popping up wherever you spread your compost
Diseased plants/leaves
Woody material unless it is shredded
Pernicious weeds, e.g. dandelion, creeping buttercup, dock, etc.
Weeds that have gone to seed, unless you can guarantee very high temperatures in your heap that will break down the seeds and prevent germination

Eco Ireland brings balance back into the Irish Environment

We are all aware of the literal meaning of the word eco-friendly. It is important to preserve the earth and the living things that exist on it.  Many have forgotten that we have a responsibility to the Earth and, while large multinational companies are the worst polluters, we can all help in our own way. 

Our site is devoted to putting Ireland at the forefront of the green revolution - our aims are to encourage everyone in Ireland to minimise pollution in a safe and cost effective way. 

These are just some of the ways in which you can help:


Walk or cycle to school or work
Use public transport
If you have to drive a car, use an energy efficient one
Insulate your house
Switch off electric appliances at source
Use long life light bulbs
Use renewable clean fuels
Buy local produce in season
Buy loose/unpackaged produce
Re-use glass jars, plastic containers, etc.
Recycle only what you cannot re-use
Compost kitchen and garden waste
Create a wild area in a corner of your garden
Grow flowers for the bees and butterflies

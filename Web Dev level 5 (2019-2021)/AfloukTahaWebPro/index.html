<h2>Once your booking is in place our app will remind you of your upcoming trip. When you’re on the way to your GoCar click “Locate my car” which will appear on screen as shown below to be guided straight to your car’s location.

After arriving at the car you’ll need to unlock it. There are two methods to do this:</h2>
<h2>
1_Hold down the unlock button on our app until the circle fills and the doors unlock<br>
2_Hold an Access Card ( see how to add one here) to the card reader on the windscreen until the light changes from red to green and the doors unlock.
</h2><br>
<h2>Either method is fine to use, we do recommend carrying your card with you as a backup option in the event network signal is bad or your phone encounters any issues.

The keys to your car are waiting for you inside. Open the glovebox and you’ll find them slotted into a keypad inside, just slide them out and you’re good to go! Remember to put the keys back in this slot to end your trip.</h2><br>

Please remember to always park legally, do not park in clearways or timeshare spots. Once you’ve parked place the key fob(small circular disc attached to the keys) back into the keypad console in the glovebox.

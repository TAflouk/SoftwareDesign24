        <p>Hassan Kamel Al-Sabbah was a technological leader whose inventions in electricity had a great impact on the development of 20th century technology. In August 1921, Sabbah travelled to the U.S. to study at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology for one year. In 1922, he enrolled at the University of Illinois, where he earned a master's degree in engineering sciences in 1923.
        </p>

        <p>He was hired by the engineering laboratory of the General Electric Company (GE) at Schenectady, N.Y. in 1923. It was not long before his research efforts resulted in a number of patents. However, Sabah had signed a contract with GE whereby all his inventions became the property of the company, and so he received a reward of one dollar for each of his patented inventions. Between 1927 and 1935, he invented 52 different applications.<br>

        Mr. C.G. Marcy, the personnel director of General Electric Company, used these words to describe Hasan Kamel Assabbah in a letter dated April 16, 1935:
        "It is indeed unfortunate that his genius mind should be brought to such an untimely end. His death is a great loss for the world of invention"

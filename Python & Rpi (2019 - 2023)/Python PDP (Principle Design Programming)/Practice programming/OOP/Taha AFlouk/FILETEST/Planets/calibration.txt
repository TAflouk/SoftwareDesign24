yet again I am having to write to you asking for payment of invoices. The invoice for May and June are both outstanding.  No invoice I have issued to you has been paid on time.  The May invoice is now 40 days late.

Regarding the work for the calibrator.  I will charge MSL for any effort put into the calibrator and generating the calibration files.  I will bear the cost of modifying Winfoot to work with the calibration files.

The work I envisage is as follows.

Design and specifying a method of calibration that will cope with:
	Inter cell differences in performance.
	Sensor hysteresis.
	Output creep depending on the length of time the cell is loaded.
	
Specify a system that will:
	Drive the calibrator if possible.
	Cater for discreet areas of the plate being calibarated at any one time.
	Capture the plate output.
	Capture the calibrator output.
	Provide the tools required to decide if the plate is setup correctly.
	Validate the calibration of the plate.
	Provide statistical information on the quality of the sensor array.
	Generate the calibration files required for Winfoot.

Develop the above program

Until step one is completed I cannot provide any estimate of how long step two will take.  There will always be a certain amount of difficultly estimating how long step two will take.  There will almost certainly be points where we will hit a brick wall in some aspect of the calibrators/electronics/software performance.

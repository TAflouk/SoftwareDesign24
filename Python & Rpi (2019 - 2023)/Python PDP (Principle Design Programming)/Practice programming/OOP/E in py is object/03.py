#                           classes
 
 
 #      each class has attribute and method
 
 
#   i can take from a class  some objects and use them as i wish for ex: class==> object1 , object2 , object3
#   another example:
#             classCar
#                    |
#                    ^
#         car1      car2   car3
#
#
#
#
#
# car1 and car2 and car3 are =  objetcjives  
#
#
#  attributes = like for color and design
#
#  methods =  what dose the car do 
#
#
#
# the difference bettween attributes (properties) and methods is
#
# you can get the methods to use it but not the attribute
#
# the class has some methods you set it down  to use it 
#
class empty():
    pass
